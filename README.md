# This repository contains files for one of my first data science projects. I used python to test the relationship 
between active satellites in Earth orbits and their masses.

I tested the following hypothesis:

H0: There is no significant difference in the average dry mass of satellites in LEO, GEO, MEO, and Elliptical Earth orbits.
Ha: There is a significant difference between the average dry mass of satellites in LEO, GEO, MEO, and Elliptical Earth orbits.
